# Tool Search

When you have many MCP servers or non-core plugin tools attached to a
session, their JSON schemas can consume a substantial fraction of the
context window on every turn — even when only a few of them are relevant
to what the user actually asked for.

**Tool Search** is Hermes' automatic progressive-disclosure layer for that
problem. In its default `auto` mode, MCP and plugin tools are replaced in the
model-visible tools array by three bridge tools when their schemas are large
enough, and the model loads each specific tool's schema on demand.

:::info Built-in Hermes tools never defer
The tools that make up Hermes' core capability set (`terminal`,
`read_file`, `write_file`, `patch`, `search_files`, `todo`, `memory`,
`browser_*`, `web_search`, `web_extract`, `clarify`, `execute_code`,
`delegate_task`, `session_search`, and the rest of
`_HERMES_CORE_TOOLS`) are *always* loaded directly. Only MCP tools and
non-core plugin tools are eligible for deferral.
:::

## How it works

When Tool Search activates, the model sees three new tools in
place of the deferred ones:

```
tool_search(query, limit?)     — search the deferred-tool catalog
tool_describe(name)            — load the full schema for one tool
tool_call(name, arguments)     — invoke a deferred tool
```

A typical interaction looks like:

```
Model: tool_search("create a github issue")
  → { matches: [{ name: "mcp_github_create_issue", ... }, ...] }
Model: tool_describe("mcp_github_create_issue")
  → { parameters: { type: "object", properties: { ... } } }
Model: tool_call("mcp_github_create_issue", { title: "...", body: "..." })
  → { ok: true, issue_number: 42 }
```

When the model invokes `tool_call`, Hermes **unwraps the bridge** and
dispatches the underlying tool exactly as if the model had called it
directly. Pre-tool-call hooks, guardrails, approval prompts, and
post-tool-call hooks all run against the real tool name — not against
`tool_call`. The activity feed in the CLI and gateway also unwraps so you
see the underlying tool, not the bridge.

## When does it activate?

By default Tool Search runs in `auto` mode. It activates when the deferrable
tool schemas reach the effective threshold, defined as the smaller of the
configured percentage of the active model's context window and the absolute
token threshold. Below that, the tools-array assembly is a pure pass-through
and you pay no overhead. If the active context length is unknown, the
absolute threshold is used by itself.

Tool schemas stay stable within a model request and its prompt-cache prefix.
An explicit `/reload-mcp`, a gateway/TUI registry refresh, or a between-turn
rebuild can update subsequent assemblies. These changes do not splice new
schemas into past context; updated schemas apply at the next assembly/request
boundary.

## Offline schema-cost diagnostic

To measure the live configured tool surface without contacting a model or
invoking a tool, run:

```bash
python scripts/measure_tool_schema_cost.py --json
```

The diagnostic performs configured MCP discovery before taking its raw tool
snapshot and uses the runtime's active-model context resolver. Its
`deferred_tools` field is the eligible deferrable catalog count, so it can be
nonzero even when the current Tool Search assembly stays inactive.

## Configuration

```yaml
tools:
  tool_search:
    enabled: auto       # auto (default), on, or off
    threshold_pct: 10   # percentage of context — only used in auto mode
    absolute_threshold_tokens: 20000
    search_default_limit: 5
    max_search_limit: 20
```

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `auto` | `auto` activates above threshold; `on` always activates if there's at least one deferrable tool; `off` disables entirely. |
| `threshold_pct` | `10` | Percentage of context length at which `auto` mode kicks in. Range 0–100. |
| `absolute_threshold_tokens` | `20000` | Absolute token ceiling for `auto`; the effective threshold is the smaller of this value and the percentage threshold. Used alone when context length is unknown. |
| `search_default_limit` | `5` | Hits returned when the model calls `tool_search` without a `limit`. |
| `max_search_limit` | `20` | Hard upper bound the model can request via `limit`. Range 1–50. |

You can also flip the legacy boolean shape:

```yaml
tools:
  tool_search: true   # equivalent to {enabled: auto}
```

## When NOT to use it

Tool Search trades a fixed per-turn token cost (the three bridge tool
schemas, ~300 tokens) and at least one extra round trip (search →
describe → call) for the savings on the deferred schemas. It's a clear
win when you have many tools and use few per turn; it's overhead when
you have few tools total.

The `auto` default handles this for you. If you set `enabled: on`
unconditionally, expect a slight per-turn cost on small toolsets.

## Trade-offs that don't go away

These come from the prompt-cache integrity invariant — they are inherent
to any progressive-disclosure design, not specific to this implementation:

- **One extra round trip on cold tools.** The first time the model needs
  a deferred tool, it spends one or two extra model calls to find and
  load the schema. The token savings on the static side are real, but a
  portion is paid back at runtime.
- **No cache benefit on deferred schemas.** A loaded `tool_describe`
  result enters the conversation history (so it does get cached on
  subsequent turns) but it never benefits from the system-prompt cache
  prefix.
- **Model-quality dependence.** Tool Search assumes the model can write a
  reasonable search query for the tool it wants. Smaller models do this
  less well; the published Anthropic numbers (49% → 74% on Opus 4 with
  vs. without tool search) show the upside but also that ~26 points of
  accuracy is still retrieval failure.
- **Refreshes wait for a boundary.** An explicit `/reload-mcp`, gateway/TUI
  registry refresh, or between-turn rebuild can update subsequent assemblies,
  but never rewrites past context or changes an in-flight request.

## Implementation details

- **Retrieval:** BM25 over tokenized tool name + description + parameter
  names. Falls back to a literal substring match on the tool name when
  BM25 returns no positive-score hits, which protects against
  zero-IDF degenerate cases (e.g. searching `"github"` against a
  catalog where every tool name contains "github").
- **Catalog follows the session's tool snapshot.** It rebuilds from that
  snapshot as needed — there is no session-keyed `Map` — and a refresh makes a
  newer registry snapshot available for subsequent assemblies. This avoids
  the class of bug where a stored catalog drifts out of sync with the live
  tool registry.
- **The catalog is scoped to the session's toolsets.** `tool_search`,
  `tool_describe`, and `tool_call` only ever see and invoke tools the
  session was actually granted. A subagent, kanban worker, or gateway
  session restricted to a subset of toolsets cannot use the bridge to
  discover or call a tool outside that subset — the deferred catalog is
  the deferrable slice of the session's own enabled/disabled toolsets,
  not the whole process registry.
- **No JS sandbox.** Hermes uses the simpler "structured tools" mode
  (search / describe / call as plain functions). The JS-sandbox "code
  mode" some other implementations offer is a large surface area; we
  skip it.
